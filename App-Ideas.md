## Basic/Intermediate

### Twitter clone

* See https://github.com/sbhackerspace/sbhx-sbitter
* This will teach you/force you to learn:
    * How to create models (like `User` and `Tweet`)
    * How to create basic relationships between models (every User has many Followers and Followees)
    * How to do basic database queries (to fetch a list of tweets, etc)
    * How to create a basic full-stack web application (HTML, CSS, front-end JS, and back end)

### New Best Friend-finder

* Users should simply be able to fill out a profile, list their interests, then have friends be recommended to them based on _whoever they share the most interests in common with_
* You'll learn the standard, core, critical stuff (creating user accounts, signup, login, password reset, confirmation emails, HTML templating/rendering, database storage and retrieval, etc)
* You'll also learn how to create profiles for social networking-type sites -- a very common site feature
* Doing AJAXy auto-complete when people enter their interests would be slick, which would also help with de-duping
* Allowing users to sign up for email notifications when someone joins the site who they have a lot in common with
* You could have people enter their zip code so they can find like minds near them
    * Bonus points for auto-detected their location based on their IP :-)
* More advanced consideration: make sure people can't spam others by claiming they are interested in everything, triggering an email to everybody!
