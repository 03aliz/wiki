Go to FreeCodeCamp's [Github Issues page](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues) and click on `New Issue`.

Crafting a good issue will make your it much easier for the dev team to replicate and resolve your problem. Follow these steps to do it right:

1. Have a useful title: `Bug` is not very helpful compared to `Broken Test on "Bonfire: Reverse a String"`.
* In the body, provide a link to the page on which you encountered this issue.
* Describe the problem and provide steps so that a developer can try to replicate the issue.
* Paste in any relevant code using proper [code formatting](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/code-formatting.)
* Take a screenshot of the issue and include it in the post.
* Click `Submit New Issue` and you are done! You will be automatically subscribed to notifications for any updates or future comments.
