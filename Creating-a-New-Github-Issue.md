Before submitting an issue try [Searching for Your Issue on Github](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Searching-for-Your-Issue-on-Github)

Crafting a good issue will make it much easier for the dev team to replicate and resolve your problem. Follow these steps to do it right:

1. Go to FreeCodeCamp's [Github Issues](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues) page and click on `New Issue`.
* **Have a useful title**: `Bug` is not very helpful compared to `Broken Test on "Bonfire: Reverse a String"`.
* In the body, **provide a link** to the page on which you encountered this issue.
* **Describe the problem** and **provide steps** so that a developer can try to replicate the issue.  Include your operating system and browser version.
* Paste in any relevant code using proper [Code Formatting](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/code-formatting.)
* **Take a screenshot** of the issue and include it in the post.
* Click `Submit New Issue` and you are done! You will be automatically subscribed to notifications for any updates or future comments.
