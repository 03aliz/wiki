In order to participate in our nonprofit projects, you first need to earn our Full Stack Development Certificate. This certificate signifies that you've completed the first 800 hours of our curriculum.

### Here's how to earn our verified Full Stack Development Certificate:

1. Complete all our current Bonfire Challenges
1. Complete all our current Zipline Challenges
1. Complete all our current Basejump Challenges

Once you've completed all of the above, you can complete our "Claim your Full Stack Development Certificate" challenge, which will require you to sign our Academic Honesty Pledge. Then we will instantly issue your verified certificate, which will become accessible from your portfolio page.

**Note that we are still writing all the logic to handle certificate issuance, and plan to start issuing certificates in early October.**
