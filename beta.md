The [beta release](http://beta.freecodecamp.com) is where we ask people to test out new features.
But your progress there will NOT be migrated to the production site!!!
Think of it as just a preview test, to check things work properly. In fact the database maybe reset at any time so we can try out things like the sign-up process.
