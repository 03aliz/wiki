We chose to feature a single nonprofit and give campers the option of browsing through a list if they wanted to. Our reasoning for this is we want to avoid the kind of decision paralysis that people get when choosing from what will surely become a large list.

If you would like to be added to the list of nonprofits that our campers can commit to, please contact us with the following information:

- the URL of a square photo of at least 300x300px that represents your organization (preferably an action shot of what your organization does with people in it)
- a direct link to your donate page, or a page with a an embedded donation button
- your donation page needs to have the option of recurring monthly payment, and allow increments of $5, $10, $25 and $50.

If we accept you, we will give you a special URL that you can share to promote your nonprofit in social media. When people follow that link, your nonprofit will be the default nonprofit to pledge to.
