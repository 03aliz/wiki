<h2>Contributing to the Wiki</h2>
<p>To contribute a wiki article for any of the Algorithms, please use this <a href="Algorithm-Wiki-Template">template</a>. This is essential for <a href="https://github.com/camperbot">@CamperBot</a> to retrieve the article. Algorithm articles that do not use this template will be removed. Please note that while we will publish solutions that can help others, we don’t need many of them and a maximum of three solutions will be accepted in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Intermediate</li>
<li>Advance</li>
</ul>
<p>One code solution per category. If we already have enough solutions and yours is similar to one we already have but you strongly feel like yours will bring something important then we encourage you to merge your solution with the similar one we already have and expand or write a detailed explanation of the code.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute but have no idea what you would like to contribute then feel free to check the open issues we have with request for articles or fixes to them <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/issues">here.</a></p>
<p>We welcome <strong>any technology related articles</strong>, not just JavaScript related or Curriculum specific. However, we do ask that you write them in third person instead of first person perspective. We also welcome articles in <strong>other languages</strong>, and welcome <strong>translations</strong> of current articles.</p>
<p>If we merge your pull request, your name will be automatically added to the document history on GitHub, and the repo’s contributors. Please don’t add additional bylines when creating or editing an article.</p>
<h3>Guides on how to Contribute</h3>
<p>They are all located on our <a href="Wiki-Central">Wiki Central</a> Page. Please take a look before anything else.</p>
