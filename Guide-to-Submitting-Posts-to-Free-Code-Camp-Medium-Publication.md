##Style tips:

- Feature a large, exciting image at the top of the page
- Break up text with good, relevant images throughout
- Break points down and use headlines and sub headlines where necessary
- Avoid the "wall of text" affect by keeping paragraphs between 1 - 4 sentences
- Use exclamation points and ellipsis sparingly
- Avoid profanity and violent or gross analogies
- Avoid using more than one conjunction in a sentence
- Keep your tone positive, and keep any criticism you may have metered and objective

##Content tips:

- Read through articles that have already been published on our publication and write about things we haven't covered yet.
- Autobiographical posts need a unique perspective or a non-obvious takeaway. 
- Technical articles are welcome, and should be written so that most people who have only been coding for a year can still understand them
- Humorous posts do quite well with our community, and even serious articles can be lightened up with humor
- [7 minutes is technically the optimal post length](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b#.jxmxzdrfa), but if you don't dilute your content to reach that length.
