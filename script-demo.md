This is a piece of demo content showing embedded scripts. 
The first paragraph should display inside the chat. It should have three lines. 
The second paragraph won't show in wiki chat, but will show if you click through.

```js
function test(a, b) {
  return (a+b);
}
```

## second paragraph
This is the 2nd paragraph of content which is "below the fold" and won't be visible in the chat.
