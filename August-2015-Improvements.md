We were up all night deploying improvements to Free Code Camp. We still aren't finished. 

If you have any issues with Free Code Camp, please let us know: https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/issues/new

Some well-known issues include: email login not working, inaccurate completed challenges (your data is fine, it's just a rendering issue), occasional crashes and overall slowness.

We just pushed the following major improvements to [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com):

- replaced our getting-started videos with a simple 10-minute process (using GIFs instead of videos)

- doubled the number of our HTML5 and Bootstrap challenges

- replaced Codecademy's JavaScript and jQuery challenges with our own challenges

- added our own Object-oriented Programming and Functional Programming challenges

- added two new Zipline front end challenges (Personal Portfolio and Simon game), and moved our Ziplines to much earlier in our curriculum

- completely replaced our Field Guide with a searchable, and easily-editable open-source wiki

- made it so your Bonfire code is stored in your browser, so if you leave the page, your code will be there when you come back

- simplified our portfolio pages. You can now click a single button to mirror your Free Code Camp profile with your GitHub profile. Bonfire solutions are no longer shown here, but they'll eventually be accessible through our API.

- fixed some issues with Brownie Points and Streaks

- improved our Camper News page by removing the (mostly unused) comments and adding one-click upvoting

- added a Creative Commons license to literally all of our images and text
everything is now an API 

- thanks to Loopback, and we will soon publish cool ways to interact with Free Code Camp's (non-sensitive) data

There will be bugs. We've spent many days testing everything, but there are always bugs. Please report these and we'll address them ASAP. Thanks for your patience and help.

If the challenge you were last doing disappeared, don't worry - you can just keep going. If you have time to go back and try our new challenges, they should be a quick review for you. Otherwise, keep moving forward.

### I can't log in with my e-mail address
If you have used an alternate authentication source like Twitter or GitHub you may be able to log in with it.  Otherwise, we are working on the problem.

### I can't submit my code on Waypoints/Bonfires
On Chrome:  Open your dev console (F12) and click and HOLD the normal refresh button.  Select 'Empty Cache and Hard Reload'.
