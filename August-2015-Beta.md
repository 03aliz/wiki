Feel free to experiment with our beta site, but note the following:

- our beta site is quite buggy. If you notice a bug, please make sure it's a new one before you create an issue.
- We've removed all authentication options other than GitHub from our beta. Don't worry - you will still be able to sign in using LinkedIn, Twitter, Google and Facebook in the future.
- Our beta database is an old version of Free Code Camp's database. Your Free Code Camp account may not yet exist on the beta site, so please create one if you want to experiment with it.
- **Youâ€™re accomplishments on the beta site will be lost.** We will not move data from the beta site onto our main database.

We plan to merge all these new beta features into freecodecamp.com as soon as we've worked out all the major bugs.
