##Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!

Our open source community's Wiki focuses on answering your questions about learning to code and getting a coding job. We also cover in detail our:
- curriculum
- local Campsite communities
- nonprofit projects

"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick", and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki. Please reference our [Wiki style guide] ([https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide)) for more direction regarding styling.

For contributing to any of the bonfires, please use this [template.](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Bonfire-Wiki-Template) This will allow [@camperbot](https://github.com/camperbot) to provide more precise help to the students.

**If you have a bonfire page that is not edited to use this template then it will be replaced either by am empty template or someone else's information.** 

The best way to access this wiki is via [@CamperBot](https://gitter.im/CamperBot), located in our Gitter channels. CamperBot is a community designed tool useful to access our wiki content without ever having to leave Gitter.
