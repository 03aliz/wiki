The number picture on Free Code Camp tells you how many Brownie Points you have.

There are three ways you can get Brownie Points:

1) Complete challenges - you get one point per challenge you complete.
2) Post relevant links on [Camper News](#) - you get 1 point for posting a link, and another point for each upvote your link gets
3) Help other campers in chat - each time you help another camper and they thank you (by typing "thanks @yourname"), you will get a point

Brownie Points help you look like the kind of person who completes challenges, shares relevant links, and helps people. They also add to your [Streak](#).
