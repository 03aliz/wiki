[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a dynamic, object-oriented, [reflective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) programming language. 

Known for its [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar), Ruby is made for developers happiness. It was created by a Japanese software engineer, [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) in the 1990s as a simple general purpose scripting language to replace Pearl for his day-to-day work.

It was not that popular initially; but as the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework was created and released; it grew in leaps and bounds, well beyond Japan.

Today, Ruby on Rails is considered a solid web framework; and it has pioneered lot of great practices in web development.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is written in Ruby. Similarly a lot of other [popular sites](https://prograils.com/posts/top-10-famous-sites-built-with-ruby-on-rails) are also coded in Ruby on Rails.
