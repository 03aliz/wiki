###"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick" and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki.

Your wiki articles should be no longer than this article. Keep them short and focused. If the Wiki is longer than this, break it up smaller wiki articles that link to each other. 

You can include an images if they help you better communicate your subject. 

Use descriptive, punctuation-free titles.

Our wiki articles are [written in GitHub-flavor Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

We are always happy to help new contributors write, edit, and localize our wiki articles. Help us make Free Code Camp the best it can be. 

If you have questions about contributing to the Free Code Camp Wiki message [@danraley](https://gitter.im/danraley) in Gitter.

We look forward to wiki-ing with you!
