# On February 11, 2015, we pushed the following changes:

## Fixing the bottlenecks that made FreeCodeCamp.com so slow
- Our open source community is growing rapidly, and this week our site has slowed to a crawl during peak hours.
- We've gone through, identified several bottlenecks, and fixed them. If everything works as planned, Free Code Camp should now be faster than ever.
- A huge thanks to [@berkeleytrue](https://gitter.im/berkeleytrue) for leading this effort, and to the many campers who helped QA these improvements.

## Introducing the new Wiki
- Our wiki is now on FreeCodeCamp.com itself (as opposed to on our main project's GitHub  Wiki). 
- Our wiki pops out like our chat and map do. We welcome feedback on this new functionality. Hotkeys, context aware wiki articles, and other features will come soon.
- Our wiki has real-time search that improves upon what GitHub offered.
- A big thanks to [@saintpeter](https://gitter.im/saintpeter), [@hallaathrad](https://gitter.im/hallaathrad), and [@awesomeaniruddh](https://gitter.im/awesomeaniruddh), along with many other campers for their hard work on this!


## Retiring Camper News
- Over the past year, Camper News has been a modest success. But so has our subreddit, which allows for commenting, moderation, and many other features. So we are shifting to Reddit for news sharing. 
- We recommend creating a Reddit account if you don't already have one and [joining our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/freecodecamp). You can now share links with our entire community there, as well as your thoughts and questions.
- We will keep Camper News live for a while, but we're removing the link to it from our navbar, and removing the challenge that introduced it.


## Updating challenges
- Many campers asked that we create an easier, HTML-focused project to proceed "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage". So we've created a new project that can be completed using only HTML and Bootstrap called "Build a Tribute Page".
- We also resequenced our front end projects. Here's how they're now structured:
  - Basic Front End Projects
    - Build a Tribute Page
    - Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
  - Intermediate Front End Projects
    - Build a Random Quote Machine
    - Show the Local Weather
    - Build a Wikipedia Viewer
    - Use the Twitch.tv JSON API
  - Advanced Front End Projects
    - Build a JavaScript Calculator
    - Build a Pomodoro Clock
    - Build a Tic Tac Toe Game
    - Build a Simon Game
- You'll note that we've removed the "Build a Camper News Viewer" project since we're phasing out Camper News. If you've previously completed that challenge, the "Build a Tribute Page" should already be marked completed for you on your map.
- Also, for "Build a Tic Tac Toe Game", you no longer need to make it unbeatable. (You certainly can if you want - [here's how](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax). Although doing so is a useful exercise, writing an AI is a departure from the project's focus, which is front end development.
- We added three new optional challenges that help you join our:
  - [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/freecodecamp
  - join our Medium publication
  - join our Twitch.tv channel

## Shop
- We have a new t-shirt campaign going on until February 15. Hurry up and buy one of these awesome Free Code Camp t-shirts: [click here for our US campaign](https://teespring.com/free-code-camp-feb) | [click here for our EU campaign](https://teespring.com/free-code-camp-t-shirt-eu-shop)
- We also have Free Code Camp laptop stickers. You get two for only $5, with free shipping anywhere on earth!

## Coming soon
- We will launch our Spanish challenges in the next few days.
- We plan to release optional React, Sass, and D3 challenges in March to teach you these technologies. But don't wait - you can complete the projects with the help of these projects' official documenation - 16 campers have already done just that.

### Happy coding!
