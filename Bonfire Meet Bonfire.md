# Explanation:
This is very simple, they just want you to get familiar with how their Bonfires work.

# Hint: 1
Read details.

# Hint: 2
Did you read all the details?

# Hint: 3
You need to change the return statement to what they ask.

# My code:

```
function meetBonfire(argument) {
  // Good luck!
  console.log("you can read this function's argument in the developer tools", argument);

  return true;
}

meetBonfire("You can do this!");
```

# My Code Explanation:
All you had to do was change from false to true.
