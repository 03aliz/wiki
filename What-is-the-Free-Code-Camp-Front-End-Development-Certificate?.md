We're creating a free Front End Development Certificate.

Here are the challenges that will make up our Basic Front End Development Certificate Program:

- HTML5 and CSS
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- jQuery, Ajax and JSON APIs (coming soon - will replace Codecademy jQuery challenges)
- Zipline: Use the Twitch.tv JSON API
- Zipline: Build a Random Quote Machine
- Zipline: Show the Local Weather
- Zipline: Stylize Stories on Camper News
- Zipline: Wikipedia Viewer

This won't be a new curriculum - it will just the first 200 hours of our full stack JavaScript curriculum.

All campers who have already completed these challenges are retroactively be eligible for the certificate!
