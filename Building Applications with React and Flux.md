# This is a development environment for React

#### With React comming to Free Code camp soon. I thought this would be a aset to the community.

 > This is designed to run in the cloud nine environment.
> Once this is installed in a custom environment at cloud nine. All you have to do is type npm install from the bash terminal.
> Then type gulp from the bash terminal.
> This should set up a development environment. For you to work with React code.
> The environment will Compile React JSX, Lint JSX and JS with ESlint, Bundle your JS and CSS files, Migrate the built app to the dist folder, and run a dev web-server.
> Thank you Free Code Camp for helping me learn to code. I hope this helps the community.
